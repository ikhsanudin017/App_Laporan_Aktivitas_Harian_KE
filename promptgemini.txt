# GEMINI PRO CLI - CODE QUALITY AUDIT PROMPT

Act as an expert code auditor and quality assurance specialist. Perform comprehensive analysis on the provided code/content.

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:

**SCAN ALL ELEMENTS:**
- Inspect every line of code, component, and UI element
- Check all variables, functions, classes for consistency
- Verify all imports, dependencies, and file structure
- Validate naming conventions and code organization

**FIX OVERFLOW ISSUES:**
- Ensure no elements exceed container boundaries
- Implement proper responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Add CSS overflow controls and text wrapping
- Test layout stability across screen sizes

**ENSURE PRECISION:**
- Validate all calculations and logic flows
- Check data types, variable scoping, and error handling
- Remove hardcoded values, use constants/variables
- Verify output formats match specifications exactly

**MAINTAIN CLEAN STRUCTURE:**
- Apply consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Remove unused code, imports, and variables
- Group related functions and organize file structure
- Add proper comments and documentation

**ELIMINATE RANDOMNESS:**
- Fix unpredictable behaviors and race conditions
- Standardize animations, transitions, and timing
- Implement deterministic outputs for same inputs
- Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Generate working, executable code** - not pseudo-code
2. **Include complete file structure** with proper imports
3. **Add responsive CSS** with mobile-first approach
4. **Implement error boundaries** and input validation
5. **Provide production-ready output** with optimizations
